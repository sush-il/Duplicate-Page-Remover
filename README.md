# Duplicate Page Remover
The system is a Python-based tool designed to remove duplicate slides/pages from PDF files, ensuring that your presentations remain concise and clutter-free.

Installation
To install the software, simply clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/sush-il/Duplicate-Page-Remover.git
```
Browse to the root directory and and install the required dependencies using pip:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Run `py server.py` to run the server

Select Presentation File: PDF file from which you want to remove duplicate slides and submit.

### Future Development Plans
- Support for multiple files upload
- Support for multiple file types

### WHY ??
The main reason for creating the system was due to difficulty in making notes when there were 100s of slides for a single lecture. 
Each slide would be just one line and then another line would be added on the next slide making the note-taking process unnecessarily long.
For one of the slides I was able to bring down the number of slides from **119** to **35** without loosing any content using the system.
